# nyc-hs-search
Goal: Create a webapp that helps users find nyc high schools that match their criteria

The deadline for applying to high schools is over, but I plan on updating it when the 2017 directory is released.

## Tasks

Currently, there are two overall tasks. I'm sure this will get more elaborate as I dig in to the project.

1. Building a relational DB
    - Convert opendata dataset into relational DB
    - Scrape data from the High School Directory PDF to add to db
2. Front End
    - need to pick framework (Django?)

## Search Criteria

I hope to add these search criteria.

    - Commute Time given Location (using Google Maps API)
    - School Type
    - Grades
    - AP Classes
    - Sports
    - Extracurricular Activities
    - Suggested GPA Range
    - Selection Priority
    - Specializations
